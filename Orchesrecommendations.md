Critical Gaps Causing "Lazy" Outputs
1. No Decomposition/Complexity Enforcement

Problem: Your PLANNING_SYSTEM_PROMPT says "Break complex requests into atomic steps" but doesn't enforce this.

​

Example: For "create a house," Gemini can still generate:

json
{
  "steps": [
    {"action": "execute_code", "code": "bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add()"},
    {"action": "execute_code", "code": "bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cone_add()"}
  ]
}

Missing: Pre-analysis CoT phase that forces the model to list components BEFORE planning.
2. No Material/Color Enforcement

Problem: Your few-shot examples DO show material application, but there's no validation that rejects plans missing materials.

​

Evidence: In executor.ts, you validate if steps succeed, but you don't check:

    "Did we create objects without applying materials?"

    "Are all objects colorless?"

What's Missing: Post-execution quality audit that auto-applies materials to unmaterialized objects.
3. Temperature Too Conservative

Current Setting: temperature: 0.2 in planner.ts

​

Problem: This is too low for creative, detailed scene generation. It favors safe, minimal outputs.

Recommendation: Increase to 0.6-0.8 for planning phase to encourage more elaborate designs.
4. Few-Shot Examples Are Too Simple

Current Examples:

​

    Example 1: Create single blue sphere (5 steps)

    Example 2: Search PolyHaven (3 steps)

Missing: Examples showing complex decomposition:

    House with 20+ components

    Car with body, wheels, windows, lights

    Explicit "BAD vs GOOD" comparisons

5. No Minimum Object/Step Requirements

Problem: Your PLAN_SCHEMA only requires min(1) step. Nothing prevents:

​

json
{"steps": [{"action": "execute_code", "code": "bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add()"}]}

Missing: Complexity scoring and minimum thresholds based on request type.



⚠️ What Needs Nuance (Adjustments to My Recommendations)

Looking at your actual codebase, I need to revise some recommendations:
1. Your Tool Structure is Different Than I Assumed

My assumption: You had create_primitive(), apply_material() as discrete tools
Reality: You use execute_code() as the PRIMARY geometry/material tool

​

This changes the approach significantly. Instead of enforcing "material steps after creation steps," you need to enforce:

    Materials WITHIN the same execute_code block that creates geometry

    No bare geometry creation without material application

2. Temperature is Already Low (0.2) - This is Actually Good for Planning

My recommendation: Increase temperature to 0.7-0.8
Reality: Your planner uses temperature: 0.2 which is CORRECT for structured planning

​

Revised recommendation: Keep planning at low temperature (0.2), but use HIGHER temperature (0.6-0.8) for the pre-analysis CoT phase to encourage creative decomposition.
3. You Already Have Validation - It Just Doesn't Check for DETAIL

Your validateStep() and performStructuredChecks() are solid, but they only verify:

​

    Tool execution success

    Object existence after creation

They DON'T check:

    Whether materials were applied

    Whether enough detail was added

    Whether colors are realistic

What I Would Actually Do (Tailored to Your Codebase)
Phase 1: Enhance prompts.ts - Add Detail RequirementsAfter thoroughly analyzing your TypeScript orchestration files and comparing them to my previous recommendations, here's my honest assessment:
Analysis: Current Implementation vs. Recommendations
What Your Code DOES Have ✅

    ReAct Framework - Your prompts.ts already implements ReAct (Thought → Action → Observation) with clear guidelines

​

Step-by-step execution - The PlanExecutor properly executes plans sequentially with validation

​

Validation & Recovery - You have LLM-powered validation and automatic recovery mechanisms

​

Tool filtering - Keyword-based filtering to show relevant tools

​

Monitoring - Execution logging for debugging

​

Few-shot examples - Two examples showing sphere creation and PolyHaven integration

    ​

Critical Gaps That Cause "Laziness" ❌

    NO Component Decomposition Enforcement

        Your PLANNING_SYSTEM_PROMPT says "break complex goals into atomic steps" but doesn't enforce geometric complexity

    ​

    Missing: "For a house, you MUST create walls, windows, doors, roof separately—not just a cube"

NO Material/Color Mandates

    Nowhere in your prompts does it say "ALWAYS apply materials and colors to every object"

    ​

    Your few-shot example shows material application, but doesn't emphasize it's mandatory

NO Minimum Object Count Validation

    Your planner doesn't check: "Did we create at least 10-15 objects for a house request?"

    Plans with 2-3 objects pass through unchallenged

NO Post-Execution Quality Audit

    executor.ts validates individual steps but never checks the final scene for:

        Objects without materials

        Too few objects for complexity

        Missing lights/camera

        ​

Temperature Too Low for Creativity

    Your planner uses temperature: 0.2 which favors safe, conservative, minimal outputs

    ​

    My recommendation was 0.7-0.8 for detailed creative work

Few-Shot Examples Too Simple

    Your examples show "add a sphere" and "search PolyHaven"—both trivial tasks

    ​

    Missing: Complex multi-object examples with materials, showing what "good" looks like

NO Chain-of-Thought Pre-Analysis

    You jump straight to planning without forcing Gemini to decompose the request first

    Missing the "list all components" step before generating the plan
