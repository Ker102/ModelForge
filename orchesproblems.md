Key Findings and Issues
1. Prompt/Guidance Weakness

    Planning prompts (in planner.ts, prompts.ts) enumerate atomic modeling steps with some thoroughness, but do not always enforce rich decomposition (house = cube + cone still slips through).

    ​

    ReAct/step-by-step structure is in place, but there’s no checklist or forced component analysis (windows, doors, walls, etc.) for complex scene requests.

  

2. Tool Registry/Filtering

    Tools for geometry, materials, lighting, and external asset import are present and discoverable.

    ​

    The system does not force selection of materials/textures for every object, nor does it reject lazy plans with <5 objects for “complex” requests.

    Keyword mapping helps contextual filtering, but planning allows for minimal/atomic geometry construction even in complex jobs.

3. Plan Execution/Validation

    Steps are checked for expected outcome and rationale (executor.ts), with recovery if responses are unsatisfactory.

    ​

    No post-execution scene audit for missing materials/colors, under-detailed geometry, or lack of lights/camera composition.

    No regeneration if plan fails a “detail/quality” standard (e.g., only 1-2 objects, or no colored models).

4. Few-Shot & Specificity

    Few-shot examples included in prompts (prompts.ts), but not enough high-complexity cases nor explicit bad-vs-good comparisons to enforce ideal outputs.

    ​

    No chain-of-thought decomposition before generation (“List all required components relevant for a house/car/tree before planning steps”).

5. Monitoring

    Execution results are logged, which is great for review but no dynamic feedback loop to trigger re-planning when scenes are poor.

    ​

What You Should Add or Fix
A. Add a Forced Decomposition Phase (CoT)

    Before generating steps, require the model to list: all scene components, required colors/materials, object counts, and spatial relationships. Use a pre-analysis prompt inspired by Claude's system.

​

    ​

B. Checklist Enforcement in Planning

    For any “complex object/scene”:

        Require at least 8-15 objects in the checklist.

        Force color/material assignment for every mesh, not only when prompted.

        Require camera/light setup if missing.

        Reject plans with fewer objects/materials than threshold unless user requests “minimal.”

C. Augment Post-Execution Validation

    After plan execution, audit the final scene:

        If <N mesh objects, trigger plan regeneration (“not enough detail”).

        For any object lacking color/material, auto-apply default or ask the model to select.

        If scene lacks lights/camera, add or ask Gemini to add.

        Return thorough quality warnings to the user.

D. Enhance Few-Shot Guidance

    Add high-detail good vs bad examples (“Car with four wheels = bad. Car with, body, doors, glass, lights, etc. = good.”).

    Use progressive examples for: house, car, tree, cityscape, furnished room.

E. Tweak Planning Prompts

    Raise temperature/top_p parameters for creative responses during planning.

    Use a mandatory planning checklist inside the system prompt.

    Reword planning rules to: “For every real-world object, break into logical sub-components and apply realistic colors and materials.”

F. Regeneration/Recovery Logic

    If plan validation fails, or post-execution audit is negative, trigger re-generation using the original user request AND your checklist of missing elements as a booster for Gemini.

G. Material Heuristics

    If material/color cannot be auto-selected, default to commonly used ones (e.g., window = glass, roof = red/brown tile, walls = beige/white, trees = brown/green, etc.).

    This can be a lookup table used by the executor or planner.

In Practice: Key Architectural Upgrades
Area	Current State	Upgrade Recommendation
Planning Prompt	Step-wise, ReAct, few-shot	Add mandatory decomposition, object count/material checklist, COT
Tool Filtering	Keyword/query based	Enforce materials+lights+camera selection always
Execution	Weak result validation	Post-run audit; auto-fix or re-plan for missing details
Few-Shot Examples	Simple cases, atomic steps	Explicit bad/good comparison, more complex scenes
Monitoring	Execution logs only	Dynamic feedback to auto-regenerate poor scenes
How to Implement These Changes

    Edit planner.ts & prompts.ts:
    Add a forced chain-of-thought analysis and checklist before planning. Explicitly reject, and regenerate, lazy plans.

    Modify executor.ts:
    After executing, audit for missing materials and mesh count. If short, send new prompt: “Regenerate with more detail, at least X objects, colors for all meshes, and appropriate lighting.”

    Enhance prompt structure:
    Use more explicit language about “professional 3D results,” “breakdown into components,” and “material/color application.”

    In tool-filter.ts & tool-registry.ts:
    Put higher priority on material/color/texture tools for any geometry step.

    In monitor.ts:
    Add a feedback result (“scene simple/missing details → needs improvement”).
