# ModelForge Project Notes (2025-10-21)

## Current Status
- Web app: AI chat with Gemini streaming, MCP connection card, usage tracking, docs/quick start fully updated.
- Desktop app: Electron shell wraps web dashboard; quick start/usage cards visible.
- MCP: Socket client + `/api/mcp/status` + `/api/mcp/execute`; addon available at `/downloads/blender-mcp-addon.py`.

## Outstanding Work
1. Wire AI chat responses to execute MCP commands via `createMcpClient()` and persist success/failure.
2. Enhance MCP command planning (translate stubs to actual Blender actions, logging results).
3. Integrate viewport screenshots / MCP results into UI (web & desktop).
4. Package Electron app for distribution (auto-update, installers).
5. Persist conversation memory with vector store (pgvector or external) + enforce quotas.
6. Add tests/monitoring for MCP connection and error handling.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Implement command execution pipeline in `/api/ai/chat` (convert stubs -> real commands, update message logs).
2. Reflect command execution status in chat UI (success/failure chips, logs).
3. Begin work on viewport analysis endpoint (screenshot capture, Gemini Vision call).

Refer to `blendermcpreadme.md` and `/docs` quick start for installation reminders. EOF
