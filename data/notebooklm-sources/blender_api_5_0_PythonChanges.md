# Blender 5.0: Python API [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#blender-50-python-api "Permanent link")

## Breaking Changes [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#breaking-changes "Permanent link")

### Removal of (Unsupported) Access to Runtime-Defined Properties Storage Data [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#removal-of-unsupported-access-to-runtime-defined-properties-storage-data "Permanent link")

Properties defined by the [`bpy.props`](https://docs.blender.org/api/5.0/bpy.props.html)
API are no longer stored in the same container as user-defined
[Custom Properties](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/5.0/files/custom_properties.html).
As a consequence, it is no more possible to access them directly through the Python 'dict-like'
syntax.

E.g. `bpy.context.scene['cycles']` will not give access to Cycles' scene settings.

For more details, see the
[commit](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/7276b2009a8819619263a1b897389662307b0ee0)
and related [design task](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/123232).

#### New `get_transform` and `set_transform``bpy.props` accessors [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#new-get_transform-and-set_transform-bpyprops-accessors "Permanent link")

These new callbacks allow to edit the value, while still using the default
(IDProperty-based) storage system.

These were required because it is now fully unsupported to directly
access the underlying IDProperty storage for `bpy.props`-defined properties,
which means that older code using `get`/`set` only to transform the value,
but still store it in the IDProperty, was not valid anymore.

Some related things to note:

- Read-only properties should now be defined using a new `options` flag, `READ_ONLY`.

- `get`/`set` should only be used when storing data outside of the default system now.
  - Having a `get` without a `set` defined forces property to be read-only
     (same behavior as before).
  - Having a `set` without a `get` is now an error.
  - Typically, a same property should not need both `get` and `get_transform`,
     or `set` and `set_transform` callbacks.
- Just like with existing `get/set` callbacks, `get_/set_transform` callbacks must always
generate values matching the constraints defined by their `bpy.props` property definition
(same or compatible type, within required range,
same dimensions/sizes for the `Vector` properties, etc.).

Note: From initial benchmarking,
'transform' versions of get/set are several times faster than 'real' get/set.

For more details, see the
[commit](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/469f54f484)
and related [design task](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/141042).

#### Tips for Extensions and Other Python Code Update [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#tips-for-extensions-and-other-python-code-update "Permanent link")

| Action | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resetting | ```<br>del obj['cycles']<br># Or...<br>obj.property_unset('cycles')<br>``` | ```<br>obj.property_unset('cycles')<br>``` |
| Copying | ```<br># Highly unsafe, as there is no check<br># performed on the content of the<br># assigned dict-like data.<br>obj['cycles'] = another_obj['cycles']<br>``` | WIP, the idea is to<br>[copy content recursively](https://projects.blender.org/Mets/blender_studio_utils/src/branch/main/properties.py#L74),<br>but could also improve handling of this feature at GroupProperty level itself... |
| Versioning | ```<br>old_prop = obj['old_data']['old_prop']<br>obj.new_data.new_prop = old_prop<br>``` | ```<br># This is the main expected use-case for<br># `bl_system_properties_get`<br>sys_props = obj.bl_system_properties_get()<br>old_prop = sys_props['old_data']['old_prop']<br>obj.new_data.new_prop = old_prop<br>``` |
| Avoid Property Handling | ```<br># Get property without triggering<br># getter callback function<br>my_var = obj.my_addon['my_prop']<br># Set property without triggering<br># setter or update callback functions<br>obj.my_addon['my_prop'] = 1<br>``` | This is no longer directly supported.<br>You may need to restructure your code to not have to rely on this.<br>Otherwise, you can define a flag to check against in your getter/setter functions (see <br>[here](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/141042#issuecomment-1683440)),<br>or force using a custom data storage (like the custom properties) with explicit custom getters and<br>setters.<br>Such bypassing of RNA properties system handling is **strongly** discouraged.<br>Do so at your own risk! |

#### IDProperties Duplication [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#idproperties-duplication "Permanent link")

For types that had their IDProperties storage actually split in two
(all of the `ID` types, and `ViewLayers`, `Bone`, `EditBone`, `BoneCollection`,
`PoseBone`, `Strip`), to ensure that no data is lost over versioning, blenfiles
from 4.5 and before get their 'custom data' IDProperties duplicated into the system ones.

While this is usually fine, in some cases it can lead to undesirable side-effects
(e.g. unexpected ID usages that never get cleared, or when there is already an
unreasonable amount of IDProperties, doubling this can cause significant performance
issues).

Some generic 'IDProperties cleanup' tooling is being worked on for Blender 5.1, but in
the mean time, add-ons can also handle their own data on a case-by-case basis,
by deleting the values hrought their old, now deprecated 'ID property' paths:

```
# Cleanup `Object.my_addon` data storage from pre-Blender 5.0 blendfiles:
for ob in bpy.data.objects:
  if 'my_addon' in ob:
    del ob['my_addon']
```

Warning

Removing this data has to be done carefully, to avoid removing actual, valid user
[Custom Properties](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/files/custom_properties.html#custom-properties).

Note

Removing these properties from the deprecated 'dict-like' user properties in IDs etc.
will fully break forward compatibility. In other words, these blendfiles, if opened again
in older versions of Blender, will only have default values for all the add-on's defined properties.

### Bundled Modules Now Private [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#bundled-modules-now-private "Permanent link")

Blender comes with various bundled Python modules,
while these were not documented as part of the public API, scripts may have imported them.

The following modules have been made private and should not be used by scripts.

- `animsys_refactor`
- `bl_console_utils`
- `bl_i18n_utils`
- `bl_previews_utils`
- `bl_rna_utils`
- `bl_text_utils`
- `bl_ui_utils`
- `bpy_restrict_state`
- `console_python`
- `console_shell`
- `graphviz_export`
- `keyingsets_utils`
- `rna_info`
- `rna_manual_reference`
- `rna_xml`

### GPU [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#gpu "Permanent link")

- Remove deprecated BGL API
( [decd88f67e](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/decd88f67efab2e622cf6c81ec62b9d93bb8bd7a))
- Remove deprecated `Image.bindcode`. Use `gpu.texture.from_image(image)` and the new `gpu.types.GPUTexture` type instead.
( [decd88f67e](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/decd88f67efab2e622cf6c81ec62b9d93bb8bd7a))

- When drawn inside python draw handler, textures returned from `gpu.texture.from_image` needs to be drawn
with `draw_texture_2d(is_scene_linear_with_rec709_srgb_target=True)` or
with the `IMAGE_SCENE_LINEAR_TO_REC709_SRGB` builtin shader.
This is not needed if the render target is known to be in Scene Linear color space.
( [e2dc63c5de](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e2dc63c5deba4e247277f90e4d0285448f801ede))

### Image & Movies [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#image-movies "Permanent link")

- `ImageFormatSettings` now has a `media_type` member that needs to be set to an appropriate type
before setting the actual `file_format` member. ( [92d5c2078e](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/92d5c2078e))

### Paint [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#paint "Permanent link")

- Brush type enum property name has changed from being prefixed with `_tool` to `_brush_type`
(e.g. `brush.sculpt_tool` becomes `brush.sculpt_brush_type`).
( [ab3c129dd9](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/ab3c129dd97fc871e6991b10281489343940fca0))
- The `unified_paint_settings` struct has been moved from the `tool_settings` struct to the mode-specific
`Paint` struct (e.g. `scene.tool_settings.unified_paint_settings` becomes
`scene.tool_settings.sculpt.unified_paint_settings`). ( [4434a30d40](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/4434a30d4042594ee2fbb95f4b9c46da38ca950a))
- Radial symmetry is now moved from the scene tool settings (e.g. as `scene.tool_settings.sculpt.radial_symmetry` )
to the mesh (as `mesh.radial_symmetry`). ( [d73b8dd4f3](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/d73b8dd4f3f5fb91cdf85311b98ff30faea14fb5))

functionality is replaced with direct control of the curve via the template.
( [0f3c6da272](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/0f3c6da27250e200130f54757b844dfbe8eb791f))
- The `brush.use_custom_icon` and `brush.icon_filepath` properties have been removed. Custom brush assets
should use the asset preview image instead. ( [4ccf435058](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/4ccf435058a5958df8b721c7470a8d0f90df9ada))

### Image [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#image "Permanent link")

- `ImageTexture` properties `filter_type`, `use_mipmap`, `use_mipmap_gauss`, `filter_lightprobes`,
`filter_eccentricity`, `use_filter_size_min` have been removed (they did nothing since 2.80).
( [PR#139978](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/139978))

### VSE [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#vse "Permanent link")

- The VSE now uses a different scene for its context:
  - The `context.workspace.sequencer_scene` (or `context.sequencer_scene` for short) is the scene
     that is used by all the sequence editors in the current workspace.
  - The `context.scene` refers to the active scene
     in the window (which can be different from the scene that the VSE uses!).
- The `end_frame` property on newly added image and effect strips
(which indirectly controlled their duration relative to the `start_frame`)
has been replaced with `length`, to support multiple image strips being added at a time.
( [PR#143974](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/143974))
- Strip add operators use `move_strips` property which allows to transform strip after it is added.
This property is enabled by default, which makes these operators modal.
( [PR#138382](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/138382))

### Assets [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#assets "Permanent link")

- `bpy.types.AssetHandle` was removed. Use `AssetRepresentation` instead.
( [85878cf541](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/85878cf541))
- `bpy.types.AssetCatalogPath` was removed, it wasn't used or available anywhere.
( [bafb63a654](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/bafb63a654))
- `UILayout.template_asset_view()` was removed. Its been superseded by the
[asset shelf](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.AssetShelf.html)
( [ae9ca35e3b](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/ae9ca35e3b))

### Theme [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#theme "Permanent link")

- The following per-editor theme properties have been removed:
  - `navigation_bar`, `execution_buts`. ( [dd43eae0d3](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/dd43eae0d3))
  - `tab_active`, `tab_inactive`, `tab_outline`. They follow regular tab widget colors now.
     ( [e8735c3203](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e8735c3203))
  - `panelcolors`, including `header`, `back`, `sub_back`.
     Replaced by global styling: `panel_header`, `panel_back`, `panel_sub_back`.
     ( [7818082d02](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/7818082d02))

### Nodes [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#nodes "Permanent link")

( [6f2988f0af](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/6f2988f0af7352c35d6e7dff779a51c5b1001dba))
- `scene.use_nodes` is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0
Currently it always returns `True` and setting it has no effect.
( [PR#143578](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/143578)).
- `scene.node_tree` was removed, use `scene.compositing_node_group` instead
( [PR#143619](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/143619)). To create a basic node tree:



```
# Old way of creating a default compositing node tree.
scene.use_nodes = True # Node tree with default nodes is created here
default_render_layers = scene.node_tree.nodes["Render Layers"]
...

# New way of creating a node tree
tree = bpy.data.node_groups.new("My new comp", "CompositorNodeTree")
scene.compositing_node_group = tree
rlayers = tree.nodes.new(type="CompositorNodeRLayers")
output = tree.nodes.new(type='NodeGroupOutput')
tree.interface.new_socket(name="Image", in_out="OUTPUT", socket_type="NodeSocketColor")
tree.links.new(output.inputs["Image"], rlayers.outputs["Image"])
rlayers.location[0] -= 1.5 * rlayers.width
```

- File Output node now takes `directory` and `file_name` as two different inputs
  - Removed:
    - `bpy.types.CompositorNodeOutputFile.file_slots`
    - `bpy.types.CompositorNodeOutputFile.layer_slots`
    - `bpy.types.CompositorNodeOutputFile.base_path`
  - Added:
    - `bpy.types.CompositorNodeOutputFile.directory`
    - `bpy.types.CompositorNodeOutputFile.file_name`
    - `bpy.types.CompositorNodeOutputFile.file_output_items`


      ```
      # Giving input sockets a custom name in 4.5:
      file_output_node = ...
      file_output_node.file_slots[0].path = "my_custom_socket_name"

      # In 5.0:
      file_output_node = ...
      file_output_node.file_output_items[0].name = "my_custom_socket_name"
      ```

- `SpaceNodeEditor.geometry_nodes_type` and `SpaceNodeEditor.geometry_nodes_tool_tree`
were renamed to `node_tree_sub_type` and `selected_node_group` respectively.
( [3d7c8d022e](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/3d7c8d022e))
- Renamed Compositing Color node output socket from "RGBA" to "Color" ( [fff3af04c4](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/fff3af04c4))
- Many compositor nodes like the Gamma Node `CompositorNodeGamma` were replaced by their Shader Node
counterpart like `ShaderNodeGamma`. See [compositor notes](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/compositor/#compatibility). Example
mitigation:



```
# Old:
n = bpy.context.scene.node_tree.nodes.new("CompositorNodeGamma")
# New:
n = bpy.context.scene.node_tree.nodes.new("ShaderNodeGamma")
```

### Animation & Rigging [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#animation-rigging "Permanent link")

- The `hide` property on the bone (e.g. `bpy.data.armatures["Armature"].bones[0].hide`)
now affects the edit bone visibility. To affect the visibility of the bone in Object or Pose mode,
use the new property on the pose bone (`bpy.data.objects["Armature"].pose.bones[0].hide`).
The property on the edit bone still exists and is unchanged.
- Pose bones now have a `select` property that stores their selection state.
(`bpy.data.objects["Armature"].pose.bones[0].select`)
Selection is synced with edit bones when going in and out of Edit Mode.
The properties `select`, `select_head` and `select_tail` of the bone itself
(`bpy.data.armatures["Armature"].bones[0].select`) have been removed.
Instead, the identically named properties of the edit bone
(`bpy.data.armatures["Armature"].edit_bones[0].select`) should be used.
- The `activate_new_action` property from the `poselib.create_pose_asset` operator was removed.
That property was already deprecated and had no effect starting from 4.5.
( [debd0c0877](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/debd0c0877e535a25c040ddb23ad50859c70db76))
- The `context.space_data.action` pointer has been removed from the Dope Sheet context
( [d1962be44c](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/d1962be44c313464ad3c4e5143418fbab076d3e0)).
Use `context.active_action` instead.
- The `action.layer_prev` and `action.layer_next` operators were removed
( [19bf803e51](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/19bf803e5152548af7e260088ff1e0679a9ac821))
- The deprecated and non-functional `INSERTKEY_XYZ_TO_RGB` flag for `keyframe_insert()`'s
`options` parameter has been fully removed
( [e6f1cd6a29](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e6f1cd6a29804f383824d2b2ab522ad34d48838f)).
- New functions & parameters to make it simpler to port code from the legacy Action API
(removed in 5.0) to the current one (introduced in 4.4)
( [dbcb701eb2](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/dbcb701eb2e6b9fbc2e74b5a469f882c4782ba83)):
  - `channelbag.fcurves.new()` and `action.fcurve_ensure_for_datablock()` now have a `group_name`
     parameter that determines the channel group the F-Curves will be put into.
     If the group doesn't exist yet, it will be created.
  - A new function `bpy_extras.anim_utils.action_ensure_channelbag_for_slot(action, slot)`
     that returns an `ActionChannelbag` for the given slot.
     If necessary, it creates a new layer and a new keyframe strip to contain that channelbag.
  - A new function `channelbag.fcurves.ensure()` that takes the same parameters as
     `channelbag.fcurves.new()`, but simply returns the F-Curve if it already exists.
- The legacy `Action` API has been removed
( [1395abc502](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/1395abc502ec2801b243c50f0ee4f83a392f3937)).
This covered the properties `action.fcurves`, `action.groups`, and `action.id_root`.

Instead of `action.fcurves` and `action.groups`, access those properties on the channelbag. Each
slot of an Action can have a channelbag. You can use the convenience functions in
`bpy_extras.anim_utils` to get one, or to ensure one exists.

Replace this legacy code:



```
# Finding:
found_fcurve = action.fcurves.find("location", index=2)

# Creating:
new_fcurve = action.fcurves.new("location", index=2, action_group="Name")
```



with this code:



```
# Finding:
channelbag = anim_utils.action_get_channelbag_for_slot(action, action_slot)
found_fcurve = channelbag.fcurves.find("location", index=2)

# Creating:
channelbag = anim_utils.action_ensure_channelbag_for_slot(action, action_slot)
new_fcurve = channelbag.fcurves.new("location", index=2, group_name="Name")
```



Replace this legacy code:



```
# Ensuring the F-Curve exists:
fcurve = action.fcurves.find("location", index=2, action_group="Name")
if not fcurve:
      fcurve = action.fcurves.new("location", index=2, action_group="Name")
```



with this code:



```
# Ensuring the F-Curve exists:
channelbag = anim_utils.action_ensure_channelbag_for_slot(action, action_slot)
fcurve = channelbag.fcurves.ensure("location", index=2, group_name="Name")
```



In a similar way, instead of `action.groups` use `channelbag.groups`.

Note that the group parameter name is different (`action_group` became `group_name`). This
clarifies that this is the name of the group, and not a reference to the group itself.

Actions themselves have not been bound to any specific data-block type since Blender 4.4. This has
moved to the Action slot. `action.id_root` has been replaced with `action_slot.target_id_type`.


Also see the [Blender 4.4 release notes](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.4/upgrading/slotted_actions/) for many examples of
how to port legacy code to the current API. Of course that does not include the changes in Blender
5.0 that are described above, but it gives a good overview.

### mathutils [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#mathutils "Permanent link")

- Native buffer protocol support was added for `mathutils` types.
This causes the underlying type of a `Vector` for example to be a `float32`
where it was previously a `float64`.

( [b856b6010e](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/b856b6010ea331ffb568d7bd9eab64f5501bb263))


## Inline Shader Nodes [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#inline-shader-nodes "Permanent link")

There is a new API for retrieving an inlined shader node tree to support
closures, bundles and repeat zones in external render engines. Additionally,
this inlines node groups and eliminates reroute and muted nodes, which
simplifies export of shader nodes. ( [c3f49cd24e](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/c3f49cd24e9658b699c86768b5ef1c072291c506)).

See the [Python API docs](https://docs.blender.org/api/5.0/bpy.types.InlineShaderNodes.html) for
more details.

## PointCaches [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#pointcaches "Permanent link")

- The `PointCache.compression` property was removed; caches are always compressed now.
( [PR#144356](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/144356))

## Deprecation [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#deprecation "Permanent link")

### GPU [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#gpu_1 "Permanent link")

- `DEPTH24_STENCIL8` and `DEPTH_COMPONENT24` are now deprecated.
When used they will use depth32f variants ( [#140644](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/140644))
- `UINT_24_8` datatype are now deprecated. When used consider using `FLOAT`.
( [#140715](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/140715))

### Shading [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#shading "Permanent link")

- `world.use_nodes` is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0.
Currently it always returns `True` and setting it has no effect.
( [PR#142342](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/142342))
To create a node tree with default nodes:



```
# Old way of creating a default world node tree.
scene.world = bpy.data.worlds.new("My new world")
scene.world.use_nodes = True # Node tree with default nodes is created here
...

# New way of creating a node tree
scene.world = bpy.data.worlds.new("My new world") # Node tree with default nodes is created here
scene.world.use_nodes = True # Deprecated, has no effect
```

- `material.use_nodes` is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0.
Currently it always returns `True` and setting it has no effect.
( [PR#141278](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/141278)).
To create a node tree with default nodes:



```
# Old way of creating a default material node tree
mat = bpy.data.materials.new("My new material")
obj = ... # Get active object
obj.active_material = mat
mat.use_nodes = True # Creates a default node tree

# New way of creating a default material node tree
mat = bpy.data.materials.new("My new material") # Creates a default node tree
obj = ... # Get active object
obj.active_material = mat
mat.use_nodes = True # Deprecated, has no effect.
```


## Additions [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#additions "Permanent link")

- Add the ability to query the Python module path from structs and properties with
`path_from_module`.
( [df7273930f](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/df7273930f30aab75c5f0b012d9abc6cacb4d98b))

### Pipeline & I/O [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#pipeline-io "Permanent link")

- Add three new RNA functions to `bpy.types.CollectionExports` to create, remove,
and reorder collection exporters ( [7f0d15b31f](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/7f0d15b31f)):
  - `collection.exporters.new('IO_FH_alembic', name="Alembic")`
  - `collection.exporters.remove(exporter)`
  - `collection.exporters.move(0, 1)`

### Rendering [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#rendering "Permanent link")

- The `render.render()` operator now supports `frame_start` and `frame_end` optional arguments.
( [PR#146022](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/146022), [PR#147169](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/147169))

### Context Logging [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#context-logging "Permanent link")

- Add the ability to log context members by calling `logging_set(True)` on the “with” target of a
temporary override. This will log the members that are being accessed during the operation and may
assist in debugging when it is unclear which members can be overridden. ( [439fe8a1a0](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/439fe8a1a0d69be6bb9e080e90b89bc6342cac82))



```
import bpy
from bpy import context

my_objects = [context.scene.camera]

with context.temp_override(selected_objects=my_objects) as override:
      override.logging_set(True)  # Enable logging.
      bpy.ops.object.delete()
```


- Command Line Logging is also avaliable to globally log all context member acccess via the `context`
logging category which replaces the previous `bpy.context` logging category. ( [e2872c0bfe](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e2872c0bfef729bcc2f03a583b100033f13c5ea0))



```
./blender --log-level trace --log "context"
```


### Working Color Space [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#working-color-space "Permanent link")

While it was already possible with custom OpenColorIO configurations,
the addition of the [Working Space](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/color_management/#working-space)
option means that it will now be more common for the scene linear colorspace
to be different than Linear Rec.709.

To get the same colors regardless of the working space, exporters can convert material,
light and other colors
[to Linear Rec.709](https://docs.blender.org/api/main/mathutils.html#mathutils.Color.from_scene_linear_to_rec709_linear).
Importers can convert from
[from Linear Rec.709](https://docs.blender.org/api/main/mathutils.html#mathutils.Color.from_rec709_linear_to_scene_linear)
to scene linear.

Alternatively if the file format supports color-space metadata,
then `bpy.data.colorspace.working_space_interop_id` may be used to identify the working space.
Common values are `lin_rec709_scene`, `lin_rec2020_scene` and `lin_ap1_scene` (ACEScg).

### mathutils [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#mathutils_1 "Permanent link")

- Add `mathutils.geometry.intersect_point_line_segment` function,
similar to `intersect_point_line` but clamps at the line-segment end-points.
( [44d04ad857](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/44d04ad8578ae7c31c1c6cc14d8b03b5387b29f5)).

### Core [¶](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/python_api/\#core "Permanent link")

- Add `bpy.data.file_path_foreach()`,
which calls a callback function for each file path used in the blend file
( [d33a6a1723](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/d33a6a172377f43e82c84ac9f130413d918afe8e)).
The callback function can return a new path, which will replace the visited path.
