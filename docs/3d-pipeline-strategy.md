# ModelForge — 3D Production Pipeline Strategy

> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-17  
> **Status:** Research Complete — Ready for Implementation Planning

---

## Executive Summary

After deep research across 15+ sources (academic papers, competitor interviews, leaderboards, API docs), we've identified **three distinct approaches** to AI 3D generation. ModelForge's procedural code-gen approach is **academically validated** by the Proc3D paper (SIGGRAPH-track) and is the only approach that produces **editable, parametric, animation-ready** output. This is our moat.

## The Three Approaches to AI 3D Generation

### 1. Neural (Diffusion / NeRF / Gaussian Splatting)
**Used by:** Rodin (CLAY/BANG), Tripo, Meshy, Shap-E, LGM, DreamGaussian

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **How it works** | Train a 3D-native diffusion model on large 3D datasets. Input: text/image → Output: mesh/point cloud/implicit field |
| **Rodin's approach** | CLAY architecture — 3D latent diffusion on 3DShape2VecSet representation. Trained on only 500K 3D assets (vs 7B images for 2D). Won SIGGRAPH 2024 Best Paper Honorable Mention. Gen-2 scales to 10B params (BANG architecture) |
| **Tripo's approach** | Proprietary neural model, image analysis → 3D reconstruction. Offers PBR texture generation |
| **Strengths** | Realistic organic shapes, fast generation (~5-30s), handles arbitrary shapes |
| **Weaknesses** | **Non-editable output** (fused mesh), poor topology, no parametric control, can't animate without cleanup, requires massive training data/compute |
| **Production readiness** | ❌ Requires manual retopology, UV unwrap, rigging — NOT animation-ready |

### 2. Procedural Code-Gen (LLM → Blender/DCC Code)
**Used by:** ModelForge (us!), 3D-Agent, Proc3D, 3D-GPT, SceneCraft, BlenderGPT

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **How it works** | LLM generates executable code (Python/Blender API) that creates 3D objects procedurally |
| **Proc3D validation** | Introduced PCG (Procedural Compact Graph) — 4-10x more compact than raw Blender code. GPT-4o achieves 89% compile rate. Fine-tuned LLaMA-3 reaches 98%. **400x faster edits** vs neural methods |
| **Our approach** | Gemini 2.5 Pro → Blender Python via MCP → 127 RAG scripts → visual feedback loop → auto-correction |
| **Strengths** | **Editable**, parametric, clean topology, animation-ready, runs in Blender (industry standard), low compute |
| **Weaknesses** | Limited to what code can express (hard for organic shapes), requires good prompts, relies on LLM code quality |
| **Production readiness** | ✅ Native Blender output — proper topology, UV-ready, riggable |

### 3. Hybrid (Neural Generation + Procedural Refinement)
**The future approach — and ModelForge's opportunity**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **How it works** | Use neural models for initial shape/concept, then procedural code for refinement, topology, rigging |
| **Example workflow** | Text → Neural rough shape → Import to Blender → Procedural retopology → UV unwrap → Material assignment → Rig → Animate |
| **Why this wins** | Combines neural creativity with procedural precision |
| **Who's doing this** | Nobody fully yet — Rodin CTO says "editing" is their 2026 focus but they're still neural-only |

## Competitor Deep Dive

### Rodin (Hyper3D / Deemos)
- **Tech:** CLAY (3D latent diffusion on 3DShape2VecSet) → BANG (10B param recursive)
- **Key insight from CTO interview:** "We chose the 3D native pipeline... if you use 2D images to recover the 3D surface, it will not be that good"
- **Revenue model:** Free to generate, pay to download
- **2026 focus:** 3D editing — upload your model and edit with AI tools
- **Weakness:** Outputs fused meshes, bad topology, NOT game-ready (CTO admits it), no rig/animation
- **Our advantage:** We output native Blender files with proper topology, materials, and can add rigs

### Tripo AI
- **Tech:** Proprietary neural model, image-to-3D + text-to-3D
- **Has API:** REST API with task-based workflow (create task → poll → download)
- **Pricing:** Credit-based (~$0.10-0.50 per generation)
- **Output:** GLB/FBX/OBJ meshes
- **Weakness:** Single fused mesh, no editing, topology requires cleanup
- **Our advantage:** Full editing workflow inside Blender, RAG-powered code quality

### 3D-Agent (3d-agent.com)
- **Tech:** Claude AI + Blender MCP (same approach as us!)
- **Closest competitor:** Uses conversational AI to control Blender
- **Weakness:** No RAG pipeline, no fine-tuning, no visual feedback loop, no production workflow
- **Our advantage:** 127 RAG scripts, visual feedback loop, conversation memory, fine-tuning pipeline, full dashboard

### Spline AI
- **Tech:** Browser-based 3D editor with AI generation
- **Focus:** Web/UI 3D (not production VFX/games)
- **Weakness:** Not Blender-compatible, limited to web export formats
- **Our advantage:** Industry-standard Blender output, full production pipeline

## The Full 3D Production Pipeline

### Idea → Production-Ready Animated Model

```
Stage 1: CONCEPT          → Text/image/sketch description
Stage 2: GEOMETRY          → Base mesh generation (code-gen OR neural import)
Stage 3: TOPOLOGY          → Clean quad-based mesh for deformation
Stage 4: UV UNWRAP          → Automated UV mapping for texture application
Stage 5: TEXTURING         → PBR materials (albedo, roughness, metallic, normal)
Stage 6: RIGGING           → Skeleton + weight painting for animation
Stage 7: ANIMATION         → Keyframe/procedural animation
Stage 8: RENDERING         → Final output (Cycles/EEVEE)
Stage 9: EXPORT            → Production formats (FBX, glTF, USD)
```

|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| Concept | ✅ Text chat | ✅ Text + image + sketch | Add image-to-prompt, sketch-to-prompt |
| Geometry | ✅ Procedural code-gen | ✅ Hybrid (code + neural import) | Add neural model import pipeline |
| Topology | ⚠️ Basic (code-gen makes decent topology) | ✅ Auto retopology | Leverage Blender's Quadriflow/Instant Meshes |
| UV Unwrap | ❌ Not automated | ✅ Smart UV unwrap | Blender's Smart UV Project via MCP |
| Texturing | ⚠️ Basic procedural materials | ✅ PBR + AI textures | Integrate texture gen models (Yvo3D-style) |
| Rigging | ❌ Not implemented | ✅ Auto-rig | Rigify addon (built-in Blender) via MCP |
| Animation | ❌ Not implemented | ✅ AI-driven animation | Keyframe gen via code, motion capture import |
| Rendering | ⚠️ Basic Cycles setup | ✅ Professional presets | RAG scripts already cover this |
| Export | ❌ Not implemented | ✅ Multi-format export | FBX/glTF/USD via Blender export API |
